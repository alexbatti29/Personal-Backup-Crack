# Description:

Personal Backup is an essential tool for managing and safeguarding critical data. This software allows users to create data copies for restoration purposes. All remote FTP recorders serve as suitable storage spaces for the portable standby activator. The application enables users to schedule restoration processes and execute multiple backups simultaneously. It is a valuable resource for monitoring crucial information. Users can set up the software to perform backups every time the system boots up, upon user deletion, or at any other convenient time.

Personal Backup saves personal data to any destination folder located on a local fixed or removable drive, Windows network server, or an FTP server. You can configure and store as many backup tasks as you wish. The selection of the files to be backed up is made on a by-folder basis. All subfolders are included automatically. But the user can exclude or include any subdirectories from or in the backup by selection or a filter. Additional criteria are the selection by file type, file age, and file name filter.
